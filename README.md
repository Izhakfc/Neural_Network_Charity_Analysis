# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Alphabet Soup is an organization dedicated in helping organizations that take care of the enviroment, improve people wellbeing and unify the world, they have invested over 10 Billion dollars in the past years, in order to analyze the impact of their donations, they want us to analyze which organizations are worth donation to and which ones are of high risk.
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:
* **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
* **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
* **AFFILIATION—Affiliated** sector of industry
* **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
* **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
* **ORGANIZATION**—Organization type
* **STATUS**—Active status
* **INCOME_AMT**—Income classification
* **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**—Special consideration for application
* **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
* **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively
